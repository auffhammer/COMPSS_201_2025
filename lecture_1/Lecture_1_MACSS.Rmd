#What about dplyr? It is an R package that makes it easier to manipulate and transform data. Itâ€™s part of the tidyverse collection of R packages, which are designed to work well together for data science tasks.

# you can do cute things with it like this. Gapminder is a sample panel dataset that has info on life expectancy, population and gdp per capita by country. 

# Let's take a look
cheese <- gapminder

# dplyr lets you chain tasks nicely. Say you want to figure out average life expectancy and country population by continent in 1973. You can think of %>% as "and then"....
